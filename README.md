# mtpc-digi
Script to analyse g4sbs output and digitise hits in mTPC. Takes in g4sbs output root file and outputs text file of digitised hits.
At the moment only the most basic digi method is uploaded here. More advanced version with diffusion and electronics to be uploaded later.

Branches:
- Main branch is the most basic digitisation. Hits in mTPC gas volume are "drifted" to GEM readouts. The readout pad is recorded, and the time since the start of the event is recorded (which includes drift time). No diffusion or SAMPA shaping is in this version. The code is slow because it uses the IsInside function of a THPoly histogram to find the hit readout pad. Due to the runtime, it is recommended to split up the number of events and farm the jobs.

How to run:
- Example local batch farm scripts are in the Farm folder to show the relevant stages. They will need to be modified for swif2 usage.
  -- split2.C is used to divide the g4sbs output into smaller root files. Change the g4sbs file name at ~ line 4, and the desired output filenames at ~ line 21
  -- CreateRunList.sh is used to create a runlist matching the g4sbs split files, The run list numbers should be the starting event of each file.
  -- submitdigi.sh sends the jobs to the batch farm, it uses the run list as a command line argument and it calls FarmDigi. FarmDigi calls the root digitisation macro. In submittodigi one has to set the running envorinment for the digitisation script and the temporary batch directory for the output files. In FarmDigi one has to set the input and output file locations and the filenames
- DigiSimpleFarm.cpp is the main macro which runs the digitisation.
